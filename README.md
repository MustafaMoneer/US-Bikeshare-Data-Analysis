<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About US Bikeshare Data Analysis Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/programdatascipython-project2)

In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

# Bike Share Data:

Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, you will use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

# Statistics Computed
You will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, you'll write code to provide the following information:

* 1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
** most common month
** most common day of week
** most common hour of day

* 2 Popular stations and trip
** most common start station
** most common end station
** most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

* 3 Trip duration
** total travel time
** average travel time

* 4 User info
** counts of each user type
** counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
** earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
